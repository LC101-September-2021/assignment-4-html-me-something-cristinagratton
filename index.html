               <p class="intro">Growing up food was a central part of my family life. 
                Daily dinners with everyone surrounding the table to discuss their day. 
                Smells of bread, pizza and pastas amongst various other major food groups were prominent in my household.
                That's why to me food feels like home. I've carried that with me, as I moved out on my own, and now that I'm married.
                For my husband and I food is our hobby, a shared passion, but it is also what brings us together at the end of every day, long or short.
                When the pandemic hit, we turned to food more than ever for comfort in our worries and in our boredom. 
                This website is about the foods we tried and the adventures we embarked upon during that period of time in our lives. 
                Because sometimes in life all we really need is love...and a bit of food.</p>
